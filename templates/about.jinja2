      <h2>Sarcastic Bio</h2>
      <p>Despite being incredibly handsome and popular I was drawn to the quiet dignity of software development for a major multinational corporation.  My years of experience editing the highschool poetry magazine and playing videogames gave me a solid foundation for my career in software development.</p>

      <h2>Errata</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I've worked in climate research groups on super computers and I've sold t-shirts.  Selling t-shirts is a lot more fun.</li>
        <li>I once killed a server in Reno just to watch it die.</li>
        <li>I'm a huge gaming geek.  Videogames (Xbox and PC mostly), boardgames (mostly euros, Taluva is my favorite), CCGs (M:TG), D&amp;D, and World of Warcraft</li>
        <li>I have many cats.</li>
        <li>I am bigger than a breadbox.</li>
      </ul>
